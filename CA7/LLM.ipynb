I don't recall ever walking out on a movie before, but I really tried to stay. The script was not up to the cast and just kept 'going and going' badly - come on! Uma Thurman doing this stuff? Fairly lame special effects. These were older characters and actors doing superficial horny 20-something lives - just sort of annoying and wrong feeling. This review is based only on the first hour - it might have gotten better. I just had to get home and see if the paint dried a darker shade than when it went on.'\n",
